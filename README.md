# Blogging Site

## Description

This blog site was created to test the functionality of a light and dark theme for websites. It also tested my knowledge of local storage and how to utilize it. Through this build, I was able to refine my understanding of local storage, attribute settings through JavaScript, and array/DOM navigation.
